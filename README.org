* Setup
** Clone: https://github.com/re5et/.emacs.d-for-my-friends.git to your home directory

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
    mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.backup
    git clone https://github.com/re5et/.emacs.d-for-my-friends.git ~/.emacs.d
  #+END_SRC

** Start Emacs
   you should be presented with this README and you can continue from there.

** Max OSX stuff:
*** use alt as meta

    Ctrl-H v (describe variable) mac-command-modifier RET
    Use customize to set value as meta

* Keybindings

  Emacs has a lot of keybindings, many of them useful.  We aren't
  going to discuss defaults, you should use the tutorial (C-h T) for
  that.

  This will be a list of things that are different or added.

** Overridden Defaults

*** C-j is remapped to C-x

   C-x is too clumsy a keybinding for as important as it is in Emacs.
   Anytime you hit C-j, it will generate a C-x for you.

   Anywhere you see C-x, you can use C-j instead.

   C-j is originally mapped to `electric-newline-and-maybe-indent` and
   will usually be bound to RET by the mode you are using.

*** M-j is used as a user prefix key

   M-j is a nice prefix key (usually user prefixes are C-c, which is
   less ideal).

   M-j is originally bound to `indent-new-comment-line`, which isn't
   that useful.

** Project Navigation

   For our practical purposes, projects are directory structues that
   have a .git folder at the top level.  You can get much fancier with
   project defenition, see here: https://github.com/re5et/simp

| M-j g   | magit status buffer                    |
| M-j f   | fuzzy find file                        |
| M-j s   | search project                         |
| M-j S-s | search entire project                  |
| M-j d   | project root dired (directory listing) |

** Bookmark Prefixed Project Navigation

   To pick a project from a bookmark and then take a project
   navigation action, you hold down Meta for the second keystroke

| M-j M-g | magit status buffer                    |
| M-j M-f | fuzzy find file                        |
| M-j M-s | search project                         |
| M-j M-d | project root dired (directory listing) |


** Frame and window movement
| M-l   | next-in-frame-window               |
| M-L   | next-multiframe-window             |
| M-h   | previous-in-frame-window           |
| M-H   | previous-multiframe-window         |
| C-S-, | Undo window configuration change   |
| C-S-. | Redo window configuration change   |
| C-S-\ | Rotate windows                     |
| M-S-\ | Swap split orientation             |
| C-S-b | move back one in window history    |
| C-S-f | move forward one in window history |

** Buffer niceities
| C-,     | indent entire buffer according to mode |
| C-S-/   | revert buffer (to last save)           |
| M-j G   | git time machine for buffer file       |
| C-x C-k | kill focused buffer                    |

** Editing niceities
| M-z       | delete from point up until characater      |
| M-o       | indent-and-open-newline                    |
| C-o       | previous-indent-and-open-newline           |
| M-S-b     | backward to word                           |
| M-S-f     | forward to word                            |
| M-S-m     | expand region                              |
| M-S-n     | duplicate current line down                |
| M-S-p     | duplicate current line up                  |
| C-S-m     | multiple cursors "mark all like this"      |
| C-S-n     | move current line down                     |
| C-S-p     | move current line up                       |
| C-S-y     | insert from kill ring search               |
| C-S-s     | search forward for thing at point          |
| C-S-r     | search backward for thing at point         |
| C-S-space | exchange mark and point                    |
| C-x f     | fill region (wrap region)                  |
| C-x C-s   | overridden save that forces save each time |
| M-j S-m   | rename buffer and file                     |
| M-j k     | copy line                                  |
| M-j M-k   | kill whole line                            |

** Jumping around
| M-j J   | bookmark-jump                         |
| C-x C-b | ibuffer (instead of list buffers)     |
| C-x C-d | dired-jump (go to directory for file) |
